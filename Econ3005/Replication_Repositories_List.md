Most empirical papers have to submit a “replication package” to the journal that publishes them. This is a folder containing all the codes and data to replicate the findings of a paper. The data and codes are submitted to an online repository.

These replication packages are useful for dissertations. It’s not always easy to find them. Sometimes, they are linked at the end of the paper on the website of the journal (search “replication” or “codes” on the page).

To help you with this search, I have prepared here links to the repositories of well-known journals in economics that publish papers related to development economics. These are not the _only_  repositories, they are just a useful starting list.

Note that some papers are exempt from submitting their data. This is typically the case for papers that use confidential data. Common examples are administrative records. Some examples are matched employer-employee data, individual health records from hospitals or public health care systems, or fiscal records from any country’s fiscal authority. In those cases, you may find a replication package, but it will only contain the codes but no dataset.
